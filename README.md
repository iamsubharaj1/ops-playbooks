# ops-playbooks

A public library of my **Ops playbooks and SOP templates** for scaling Customer Ops (onboarding, renewals, escalations) and stabilizing multi-location operations.

This repo is intentionally practical: each playbook is written so a team can copy it, assign ownership, and run it weekly without heroics.

## What is inside
- **Playbooks**: end-to-end operating guides for repeatable execution
- **SOP templates**: step-by-step procedures where consistency matters
- **Checklists**: audits, launch readiness, and quality gates
- **Templates**: trackers, scorecards, and communication formats

## Table of contents
### Customer Ops playbooks
- `/playbooks/customer-ops/Escalation-Playbook.md` (severity, SLAs, comms, closure)

- `/playbooks/multi-location/SLA-Exception-Handling.md` (classification, containment, prevention)
- `/playbooks/multi-location/Incident-Response.md` (containment, updates, postmortems)

- `/playbooks/governance/Decision-Log.md` (context, options, call, owner, next steps)

## Playbook format (how everything is written)
Every playbook follows the same spine:
**Outcome → Scope → Ownership (RACI) → Signals/Thresholds → Routine → Interventions → Templates → Closure**

## How to use
1. Pick one playbook (start with Escalations or Renewals).
2. Assign an owner and run it weekly for 3 cycles.
3. Add thresholds and templates.
4. Automate repeatable steps only after the loop is stable.

## Privacy note
Everything here is generalized and sanitized. No customer names, private identifiers, or confidential internals.
